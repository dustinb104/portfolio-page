                <hr>

                <div class="px-5 pb-3 pt-3 art-border">

                    <p>This artile is an overview of the specifications that this app will have such as user stories, frontend view, backend features, and database features.</p>

                    <h3>User Stories</h3>
                    <p>In the Team Management App there will be different types of uses, each with their own features and some are more restricted than others. The three user stories that this application will have will be admin user, registered user, and unregistered. </p>

                    <p>Unregistered users will be the most restricted of the three user types. These users will only be able to view general information on the teams such as team name, team members, schedule, record, managers, and coaches. </p>

                    <p>Registered users will be less restricted than unregistered users. Registered users will have to create an account and then be registered to a team. These users will have all features that unregistered users have plus the abilities to log in, access team page, and to send and receive messages within the app. </p>

                    <p>Admin users will be the least restricted of all users. Admins will have to create an account and team to manage. These users will have all of the abilities of registered users plus the ability control other users’ access to data on the app, to alter the databases like creating a team, adjust ream roster, update schedules, make team announcements, and update statistics. </p>

                    <h3>Frontend Features</h3>
                    <p>The front end of this application will have multiple views. The first being the login view. From this view the user will be given the option to login, register, recover password, and to continue as a guest/unregistered user.</p>

                    <p>The next view would be the general view which will contain general information about the team such as team name, roster, schedule, statistics, and chat. The general view will be more restricted for unregistered users, blocking some features such as the chat function. </p>

                    <h3>Backend Features</h3>
                    <p>The backend of the app handle user authentication, chat room hosting, and to retrieve and update information that will be stored into the database.</p>

                    <h3>Database Features</h3>
                    <p>The database will store user credentials, player’s personal information (name, date of birth, email address, and team stats), schedules (practices, games, and special events), and chat logs between registered users and admins. </p>
